The first ESP8266 version is on the Hacksterio site

The next versions are all here 

Heads Up --- This code is always in flux, It is supplied as is. 
Which means at times it can be broken (but not often, ish, maybe, well).

Please feel free to use it, go solar and help our home planet.

Third cut is sort of on version control will now detect changes to the EEPROM structures and automatically
do a factory reset on power up. It does not however save so you can dumpster dive your data from EEPROM is you wish
or you can reload from EEPROM if you wish. This to give the highest probability of a successful boot up

29/06/2019 Fixed the issues on the outputs when I combined the code from first and third versions.
All tested on hardware in the workshop now so should be a little better.

08/05/2020  Did a minor update but not tested on full hardware yet - just the CPU.(for an uptime meter)

2022/01/05 - Finially got around to doing that fix for Northern Hemisphere

2022/06/07 - Epic Update this time.  
Email Alarms + Wind Parking / Control for multiple trackes + time sync.
Changed web GUI code to transmit bigger packets.
Also added data loggining into the RTC module memory + download of data to CSV
For added buzz there is a chart output using google charts.
This is still all in testing ... Your milage may vary.
