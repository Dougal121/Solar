I'm using the same old libraries as before so just go check the folder I created for them or find them online.
Speaking of, Thanks to all those peoples whose work is in the libraries for without you this project would have been way harder.<br>

2020/03/08  - At last the first cut of the ESP32 version is done (heads up - not tested on hardware yet)<br>
2020/04/26  - Fixed coding issues that have surfaced in other projects sharing commmon code.<br>

<br>As always GO SOLAR and letâ€™s try and save our environment and ourselves.
